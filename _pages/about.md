I am a recent graduate of the UChicago MAPSS program, earning my MA in Social
Science, after completing my undergraduate studies at UChicago with a BA in Economics and 
a minor in Inequality, Social Problems, and Change. I am interested in economic
inequality, particularly the racial wealth gap and the social factors which
contribute to it.
